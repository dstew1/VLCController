# VLC Controller V1.0
Python script that can take you to a certain timestamp in a video being played in VLC
<h2>Project Explanation:</h2>
This is a small unique coding project that could potentially be used in a store or in many other environments. If your store has videos playing on loop that showcase a variety of products, you could use a modified version of this script so that given a input 0-9 on a keyboard, it will take you to the starting timestamps of all the different products so that you are able to show a customer a specific demonstration without having to wait through the whole loop. It could be used for many different tasks given just a little modification. 

<h2>Tutorial on how to easily run:</h2>

<br />
Step 5: Edit the code so that it suits your needs, as well as making the file path correct for both VLC and the video file
<br />
<br />
Step 6: If VLC is downloaded and the code has no errors, run it by putting "python Mediaplayer.py" in the terminal

If there are errors check that your file paths are correct.

All done!
